# Dratewka the shoemaker

## About the game

```
Dratewka the Shoemaker is a text adventure game, based on the Polish folklore legend of the Dragon of the Wawel Hill. The protagonist of the game is a shoemaker named Dratewka who has to find a way to get rid of the evil dragon, living in the cave at the foot of the Wawel Castle mountain, terrorizing local residents and animals. The player wanders around a town and its surrounding landscape. He may collect items and use them at the appropriate places. Prior to the final meeting with the dragon Dratewka must prepare sulfur stuffed sheep.

The text in the game is supplemented by location graphics and directional compass. The player performs activities using text commands. Only one item can be carried at the same time.
